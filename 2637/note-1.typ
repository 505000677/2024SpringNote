#definition(name:"On Design")[
  - Design is an iterative process:
    - To synthesize a solution from all the relevant constraints
    - To frame, or reframe, the problem and objective
    - To create and envision alternatives
    - To select from those alternatives
    - To visualize and prototype the intended solution

#definition(name:"Design as a process")[
  - Design process is iterative and explorative, constantly involving users and investigating use, since we can't just trust our instincts
  - Group project – propose and carry out end-to-end design process

#question(name:"Typical Goals in HCI Practice")[
  - Usability: Ability to use a system to successfully complete a task
  - User experience: Thoughts, emotions, and perceptions that result from interactions with a system
  - Impact: How does the system influence the user's daily life?
]

#definition(name:" Research Contributions in HCI")[
  - Empirical Research Contributions: "provide new knowledge through findings based on observations and datagathering"
    - "arise from a variety of sources, including experiments, user tests, field observations, interviews, surveys, focus groups, diaries, ethnographies, sensors, log files, and many others"
  - Artifact Contributions: "reveal new possibilities, enable new explorations, facilitate new insights, or compel us to consider new possible futures"
    - "include new systems, architectures, tools, toolkits, techniques, sketches, mockups, and envisionments"
  - Methodological Contributions: "create new knowledge that informs how we carry out our work ... research or practice"
    - "may influence how we do science or how we do design. They may improve how we discover things, measure things, analyze things, create things, or build things"
  - Theoretical Contributions: "consist of new or improved concepts, definitions, models, principles, or frameworks"
    - "inform what we do, why we do it, and what we expect from it"
